# post_processing 

Directory for storing post-processing utilities. Note these are fairly generic and may have to be adapted to meet the specific features of each simulation. 

## Data cleaning
The data_cleaning directory contains shell scripts used to clean the outputs of simulations to convert them into purely numerical format for data analysis.
